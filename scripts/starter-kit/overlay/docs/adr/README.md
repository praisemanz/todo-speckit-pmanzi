# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Durable **why** decisions for cross-cutting concerns that outlive any single feature spec.

| Artifact | Question |
|----------|----------|
| [Constitution](../../.cursor/rules/constitution.mdc) | What are the non-negotiable laws? |
| [Cursor rules](../../.cursor/rules/) | How must we implement (patterns)? |
| **ADRs** (`docs/adr/`) | Why did we choose this approach? |
| [Feature specs](../../features/) | What must the product do? |
| [Quality attributes](../nfr/README.md) | What app-wide NFR / ility bars apply? |
| [Reference](../../features/reference/) | What exists on `dev` now? |

ADRs do **not** replace feature specs or Cursor rules.

## When to write an ADR

| Situation | Write an ADR? |
|-----------|---------------|
| New product behavior for one feature | No — use `features/feature-N-*.md` |
| Ongoing coding pattern for the team | No — use `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| Significant stack or architecture choice | **Yes** |
| Security or data-isolation model | **Yes** |

## File naming

```

```

- **Number:** four digits, sequential (`0001`, `0002`, …). Never reuse a retired number.
- **Status:** `Proposed` | `Accepted` | `Deprecated` | `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`
