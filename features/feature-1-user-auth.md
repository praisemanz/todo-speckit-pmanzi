# Feature: User Authentication & Session Management

**Feature ID:** 1
**Branch pattern:** `feature/1-user-auth`
**Status:** Ready
**Created:** 2026-01-15
**Input:** Multi-user authentication and session management so each user can sign in and access private todo data
**Related:** [ADR-0001 — Client–server multi-user architecture](../docs/adr/0001-client-server-multi-user-architecture.md), [ADR-0002 — Security architecture](../docs/adr/0002-security-architecture.md)

## User Stories

### US-1.1: Register an account
**As a** new user  
**I want to** create an account with my name, email, username, and password  
**So that** I can sign in and manage my own private todo lists

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Submit valid registration and land on protected home with `user` in `localStorage`  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.1 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.2: Sign in
**As a** registered user  
**I want to** sign in with my username and password  
**So that** I can access the application dashboard securely

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Sign in with known credentials and receive session token + redirect to home  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.2 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.3: Stay signed in across page loads
**As a** signed-in user  
**I want** my session to persist in the browser  
**So that** I do not have to sign in again every time I refresh the page

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Refresh or revisit protected route with valid `localStorage` session — no re-login  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.3 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.4: Sign out
**As a** signed-in user  
**I want to** sign out  
**So that** no one else can use my account on a shared device

**Priority:** P2  
**Independent test:** Sign out clears server session and `localStorage`; user lands on login  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.4 under Acceptance Criteria

### US-1.5: Block unauthenticated access
**As the** application  
**I want to** require a valid session for all non-auth screens  
**So that** users can only see and modify their own data

**Priority:** P1  
**Independent test:** Navigate to protected route without session → redirect to login; API without token → `401`  
**Acceptance scenarios:** see ### US-1.5 under Acceptance Criteria

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST authenticate with **username** + **password** (not email-only login).
- **FR-002**: Registration MUST collect first name, last name, email, username, and password.
- **FR-003**: Passwords MUST be hashed with **bcrypt** (`SALT_ROUNDS = 10`) before persistence; hashes MUST never be returned by the API.
- **FR-004**: Sessions MUST use a **JWT + Session table** pattern: token stored server-side; client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **FR-005**: Session lifetime MUST be **24 hours** from creation.
- **FR-006**: Login MUST reuse a non-expired session for the same user when one already exists.
- **FR-007**: Default role for new users MUST be `worker`.
- **FR-008**: Every authenticated request MUST resolve to exactly one user via `req.user.id` from the session token (foundation for Features 2–3 ownership).
- **FR-009**: Registration MUST use shared `emailRules` from `frontend/src/config/validation.js` — required plus regex (`/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`); invalid format message: **"Enter a valid email address."**

---

## Assumptions

- Greenfield app — no existing users or external identity provider.
- Single browser `localStorage` session per device (no multi-tab sync beyond shared storage).
- Lists and todos are deferred to Features 2–3; Feature 1 delivers auth and a minimal protected home placeholder only.

## Edge Cases

- Duplicate username or email on register → `400` with clear message.
- Invalid login credentials → `401` (same message for wrong username or password).
- Missing or expired token on protected API → `401`; frontend clears session and redirects to login.
- Whitespace-only required fields → rejected (client and/or server).

## Success Criteria

- **SC-001**: Every Gherkin scenario in this feature has at least one automated test before merge.
- **SC-002**: A new user can register, sign in, reach the protected home page, and sign out in one manual pass.
- **SC-003**: `npm test` passes with backend auth and frontend router/register/login coverage.

## Data Ownership & Isolation (foundation)

Feature 1 establishes identity; Features 2–3 enforce per-user data boundaries.

*   Each user account is a separate tenant boundary for todo lists and items.
*   No API in this feature returns another user's profile or session.
*   Later features must never expose lists or todos across users — not in list responses, detail views, or error messages that confirm another user's resource exists.

---

## API Requirements

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|----------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/todo/register` | No | Create a new user account |
| `POST` | `/todo/login` | No | Authenticate and return session payload |
| `POST` | `/todo/logout` | Yes | Invalidate current session token |

**Login / register success response** (flat JSON, no envelope):
```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "username": "jdoe",
  "email": "jdoe@example.com",
  "fName": "Jane",
  "lName": "Doe",
  "role": "worker",
  "token": "<jwt>"
}
```

**Error response:** `{ "message": "Human-readable explanation." }` with appropriate HTTP status.

---

## Screen Requirements

### [View: Login Page] — route name `login`
*   Full-screen auth layout (no `MenuBar`).
*   Fields: username, password.
*   Primary action: **Sign in** (`v-btn`, shows `:loading` while request is in flight).
*   Link or button to navigate to registration.
*   Inline error via `<v-alert type="error">` on failed login.

### [View: Register Page] — route name `register`
*   Full-screen auth layout (no `MenuBar`).
*   Fields: first name, last name, email, username, password, confirm password.
*   Email field uses shared `emailRules` from `frontend/src/config/validation.js` (required + regex format).
*   Primary action: **Create account**.
*   Link or button to navigate to login.
*   Client-side validation before API call; server errors shown via `<v-alert type="error">`.

### [View: Dashboard placeholder] — route name `home`
*   Minimal protected landing page shown after successful login (full dashboard built in Feature 2).
*   Displays a welcome message using the user's first name.
*   **No `MenuBar`** in Feature 1 — auth pages and this placeholder use a full-screen layout only.
*   **Sign out** button on this page (standalone `v-btn`; removed from page content when `MenuBar` is added in Feature 2).

---

## Key Entities

- **User**: registered account (name, email, username, role); owns future lists and todos.
- **Session**: server-side record tying a JWT token to a user; expires after 24 hours.

*   **Then** I am redirected to the home page

#### Scenario: API request includes session token
*   **Given** I am signed in
*   **When** the frontend makes an authenticated API request
*   **Then** the request includes header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

#### Scenario: Protected API request succeeds with a valid session
*   **Given** I am signed in as user A
*   **And** user B also exists
*   **When** I send an authenticated `GET /todo/lists` request
*   **Then** the API returns `200`
*   **And** only lists owned by user A are returned

#### Scenario: Expired or invalid session token
*   **Given** I am signed in with an expired or revoked token

*   **And** `localStorage` key `user` is cleared
*   **And** I am redirected to the login page

---

### US-1.4 — Sign out

#### Scenario: User signs out
*   **Given** I am signed in on the home page
*   **When** I click **Sign out**
*   **Then** the API invalidates my session token on the server
*   **And** `localStorage` key `user` is removed
